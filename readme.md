## Introduction
This tool designed as a Notepad++ plugin by [Yonggang Luo](luoyonggang(at)gmail.com), when
it installed as a Notepad++ plugin, it's will automatically replace the system default notepad.exe
application with Notepad++ (Without need for removing anything from the windows system.).
It's tested under Windows 7, but Windows XP should also works.

This tool is based on the sources from [npplauncher](http://superstepho.free.fr/)
by [Stepho,2005] and [npplauncher at sf](http://sourceforge.net/projects/npplauncher/)
by [Mattes H. Mattesh,2013](mattesh(at)gmx.net).

## Design
NotepadStarter make use of a debugger feature in Windows the system will call a hooked 
process with appended parameters to allow debugging the intended application.
This hook application will be call whenever the correct application was resolved.
  
notepad.exe receives always only one parameter which is now just deferred to Notepad++.
Because notepad.exe is a blocking executable, so NotepadStarter behaves blocking as notepad.exe.
Notepad++ have multiple tab page, so NotepadStarter will terminated when the corresponding
tab page closed or the corresponding Notepad++ application is closed.
